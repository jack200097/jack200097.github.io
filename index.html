        <h1>The Snowboard Game: Overview</h1>
        
        <a class="overview">The Snowboard Game is a realistic skill based snowboard game with natural physics set in multiple immersive mountain locations and snow parks.You can do many things in the game, ranging from performing epic stunts in the backcountry or just hanging around in the park with your buddies!Create your own snowboard career in story mode where you meet other enthusiasts and pro boarders that will challenge you to learn new tricks, or get down the mountain in a new way. Complete missions and compete in online events or player created challenges to earn money, fans and equipment.
<br>
<br>
        There is an online hangout mode where you can shred with your friends. You can still do your own challenges and missions separately and see what your friends are up to.
        The tour multiplayer is asynchronous so everybody competes against each other in the tour events. They are divided by leagues and divisions and the leaderboards reset every day. Every time you place top three it will save your ghost to everybody playing the event. Everybody starts in the "Amateur League" which will not get you any prizes, so you will have to play the story missions to rank up in the divisions.
<br>
<br>
        If you find a spot you like, you can create a session to build jumps and place props to create a video to upload to your fictional video channel. A challenge is time or score based challenge and can be found by anybody. Creating challenges can earn you money, while playing challenges only earns you fans.
        Right now there are five fictional handcrafted mountains in three different mountain areas. Each mountain has a few story missions that will progress the story and unlock new locations, a few online events and usercreated challenges.
<br>
<br>
        The focus of development has been to create natural and immersive physics while still being fun with tight and responsive controls.</a>
